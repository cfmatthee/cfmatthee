## Welcome to the GitHub profile of an Electronic Engineer with a programming problem

This repository contains a combination of private and work related projects. I generally use the following languages:

- I would love to do everything in **Rust**, but that would not be practical, so it is mostly reserved for pet projects. I'm currently experimenting with **Dioxus** and **Tauri** for Desktop and Android applications.

- When it comes to web development, I will look to **SvelteKit** (given no other constraints that require something else). **Astro** is also a good framework for more statically based site, or sites with little interactivity. I still want to give **Leptos** a try, or maybe **Dioxus** for a full-stack app or SPA.

- The **Python** is all work related and are for projects that have not yet moved to a work specific repository. Data is downloaded from instruments, analysed and additional data products are generated. Python is also used to monitor or control instruments. Even though there are possibly better languages for this, when one works with scientists, Python end up being the best for future maintenance.

- The **TeX/LaTeX** files in this repository are used to generate both the learner notes and presentation slides from the same source material for courses that I present. This allows for variants and makes it easy to change the template while keeping the notes and slides synchronised.
